        Since I am very new to this field I don't have much experience
        and haven't worked on any projects as yet. But I would like to 
        share a couple of workshops we did as part of the bootcamp.

    <div class="Project1">
      <h1 class="fptitle">First Project</h1>
      <img src="Images/Pic2.jpg" alt="First" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
      <img src="Images/Pic3.jpg" alt="Second" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
      <p class="exp1">This workshop was very early on in the bootcamp, we were 
        just introduced to html and we built this very basic webpage 
        with the help of html. As the screenshots dipict we were supposed 
        built a webpage with different zoo  animals, name what animal it
        was, attach a picture of the animal. Give a couple of names for 
        the animal in list format and finally setup a link where one can 
        read interesting facts about the animal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Project2">
      <h1 class="sptitle">Second Project</h1>
      <img src="Images/Pic1.jpg" alt="Third"style="width:400px;height:400px;">
      <p class="exp2">
        This workshop was very interesting, we had to create a grocery 
        list with different sections like pantry and freezer item, then
        add sub sections like canned foods, dry goods, veggies and snacks
        and finally add a picture of the food for that particular section.
        We build this webpage by using html and also CSS for styling. Here, 
        we were introduced to more tags and more css elements to help with
        the appearance of the webpage.
