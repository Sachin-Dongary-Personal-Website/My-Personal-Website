# My-Personal-Website
I created my personal website using some basic HTML and CSS for styling. It was a simple website to show and share something personal about myself. 
To describe my personal website, I kept it simple with a background, adding three pages home, about, and portfolio. 
The home page was basic with my name mentioned on the top left corner of the page and the three tabs for the three pages on the right. Then an introduction to what I am currently doing and what I would like to do in the future and end this page with a quote from Maya Angelou. 
The About page was basically the three things I do the most work, watch TV, and go for a walk sometimes. On this page, I inserted three images depicting each activity explained briefly below every image. 
The Portfolio page was about the two workshops I had worked on in the boot camp since I havenâ€™t worked on any project previously. I added a few screenshots and described what the workshop was about.
