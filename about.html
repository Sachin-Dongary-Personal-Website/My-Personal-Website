      <p>
       <span class="about1">Walking:</span> Lately I have been making a point to go for a walk when I 
        find time. It helps me relax, think about stuff which I wouldn't think 
        off if my mind was busy either studying or working. It also helps me to 
        get my steps in for my goal of lossing weight.

    <section class="watching">

      style="width: 250px;height: 250px;">
      <p><span class="about2">Watching TV:</span> I've always been a person 
        who enjoyed watching TV/movies. Big fan of Stand-up comedy, documentaries,
        almost all genres of TV and movies. This helps me to relax and not stress
        about anything that is bothering me. It is kind of an escape for me.

      <section class="work">
        <img src="Images/Amazon.jpg" alt="working">
        <p><span class="about3">Working at Amazon</span>
          The thing that consumes most of time is working, I've been a Amazon
          employee for little over 3 years. It's a great company to work for, 
          they have great benefits, a flexible schedule. At some point I would 
          like to work at Amazon in the capacity of a developer.
